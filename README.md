# Book-Translation-Comparison
My goal with this project is to test the translations that exist of "the Analects", one of the most famous classical Chinese texts. There are countless translations that exist and I am curious to see how they differ from each other. To see this, I have selected translations by different authors. I also am curious to see if different translations of the same book by the same author change over time.
